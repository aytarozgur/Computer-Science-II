---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What is algorithm ?
   - Algorithm: A sequence of unambiguous instructions for solving a problem
   - 'unambiguous' means not exactly specified (ie 'pinch of salt')

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Euclidean Algorithm  (gcd)
  - What is a valid algorithm?
## Complexity of Planarity Algorithms

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Why study algorithms?
  - Theoretical importance 
    - the core of computer science
  - Practical importance
    - A practitioners toolkit of known algorithms
    - Framework for designing and analyzing algorithms for new problems

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Two main issues related to algorithms
  1. How to design algorithms
  2.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Analysis of algorithms
  - How good is the algorithm?
    - Space efficiency
    - Time efficiency
  - Does there exist a better algorithm?
    - Lower bounds
    - Optimality

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Interval Scheduling
  - Greedy Template approach to problem solving  
    - Consider jobs in some order. Take each job provided it's compatible with the
      ones already taken. Consider job in 
      - Earliest start time 
      - Earliest finish time
      - Shortest interval
      - Fewest conflicts
